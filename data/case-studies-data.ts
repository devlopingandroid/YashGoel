      whatIsIt: "During my internship at DRDO (June 2026), I observed that most personal finance applications focused on only one aspect of money management—either expense tracking, budgeting, or investment monitoring. Users often had to switch between multiple platforms to understand their complete financial picture. To address this problem, I worked with a team to build Budget Eagle, an AI-powered personal finance and wealth management platform that centralizes expense tracking, budget planning, investment monitoring, and financial analytics into a single intelligent dashboard.",
      whyCreated: "The goal was not just to record financial data but to help users understand spending behavior, identify financial patterns, and make more informed financial decisions using AI-driven insights rather than static spreadsheets.",
